# IV Fluid Monitoring System

A comprehensive computer vision system for monitoring intravenous (IV) fluid administration, featuring both **drop counting** and **fluid level detection** capabilities.

## üéØ Project Overview

This system provides real-time monitoring of IV fluid administration through two main components:

1. **Drop Counting System** - Tracks individual drops and calculates drip rates
2. **Fluid Level Detection** - Monitors remaining fluid levels and provides alerts

## üöÄ Features

### Drop Counting System
- **Real-time drop detection** using YOLO-based object tracking
- **Drip rate calculation** (drops per minute) with configurable time windows
- **Visual tracking interface** with bounding boxes and track IDs
- **CSV logging** of drip rate statistics
- **Side-by-side dashboard** showing live video and statistics

### Fluid Level Detection
- **CNN-based classification** of fluid levels (0%, 50%, 80%, 100%)
- **Real-time monitoring** with visual dashboard
- **Alert system** for low fluid levels (‚â§50%)
- **Image preprocessing pipeline** with negative filtering
- **2x2 visualization grid** showing processing steps
